To best serve the clients request Questfore used Joomla CMS as the website platform. The client wanted a custom design, and the design team at Questfore designed the website and site map. After the design arrived, my tasks were to leverage Joomla CMS to create a traditional website. On the front-end side of development I created custom templates, user interface, user experience. On the back-end side of development I set up user-names, passwords and the database using PHP MyAdmin.",
